        Why is Photography Important?
      </h2>
      <div class="paragraphdivision">
          <p>
            Why does photography matter? It’s a question that we all ask at one
            time or another. After all, why do we keep waking up at 4:00 AM to
            photograph the sunrise, when we could be warm and comfortable lying
            in bed? Why do we spend long hours tweaking our compositions and
            learning about photography fundamentals when we could be watching
            television or out with friends? And some days, when we have no
            creativity at all and pressing the shutter button seems like the
            hardest thing in the world, we continue to persevere – but why? What
            is it about photography that’s so compelling? What motivates us to
            keep going?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Our photographs tell us what is important to us
            </li>
            <li>
              Photographs are part of our legacy
            </li>
            <li>
              Photographs allow us to share and to communicate
            </li>
            <li>
              Photography is a complex language
            </li>
            <li>
              Photography makes us artists
            </li>
            <li>
              Photography has the power to move us
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Photography, at its best, is a powerful language that speaks to our
            emotions. It allows us to tell our story and shows others our
            framing of the world around us. Our images can express joy and
            sorrow, wonder and sympathy. Every human emotion can find a place in
            photography. Hopefully, you now have a better sense of the different
            reasons people pursue photography – and why photography is
            important. Now I’d love to know: Why do you do photography? What
            motivates you to keep taking pictures? What is it about photography
            that inspires you?
