        <h2>About the DG Mechanical Ultra</h2>
        <div class="about_text">
          <p>
            Since the creation of mechanical keyboards, video games have pushed
            a single request upon the industry: a sleek, tactile keyboard that
            balances comfort during long term usage with the ultra-low response
            times needed for higher level play. While this feat was thought to
            have been impossible for the greater part of the decade, our team
            has finally developed what we believe to be the forefront of the
            industry. The DG Mechanical Ultra not only achieves these goals with
            ease, but it surpasses the expectations of nearly all who are ready
            to use it.
          </p>
          <p>The DG Mechanical Ultra boasts the following specifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>3 millisecond response time upon keydown</li>
            <li>Interchangeable Cherry MX switches</li>
            <li>LEDs with 18.6 billion color range</li>
            <li>Colorful LEDs that interact with a library of 3000+ games</li>
            <li>
              Interchangeable keycaps with high durability and a textile feel
            </li>
            <li>10 remappable function keys</li>
            <li>8 ft ultra speed cable</li>
            <li>Comfortable padding for resting wrists</li>
            <li>Full compatibility with the DGaming Suite software</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The DG Mechanical Ultra will be available for purchase starting
            February 1, 2021 online and at select retailers. If you can’t wait
            that long, you also have the option to pre-order online. All
            pre-orders will not only be shipped straight to your house, but will
            also include a small variety of DGaming merchandise that you can use
            to decorate the rest of your peripherals!
